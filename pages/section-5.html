      <p class="lead">A Different Approach: Why 'Sahayata' Is a Promise We Can Keep</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about">
      <div class="narrow">
        <p>Why will 'Sahayata' work where others have failed? Because it is built with a student's heart in mind. It is not a business; it is a lifeline. It is designed to be the one place a student can turn to and feel safe, understood, and supported.</p>

        <h2>Built for Students, Not for Everyone</h2>
        <p>Unlike a national helpline or a generic wellness app, every part of 'Sahayata' is designed specifically for the life of an Indian college student. The tools are not about general stress; they are about "Managing Exam Anxiety" and "Coping with Placement Pressure." The support groups are not for everyone; they are for students struggling with "Hostel Life" and "Parental Expectations." This deep understanding makes students feel seen and heard in a way that no other platform can.</p>

        <h2>A Complete Circle of Care, Not a Dead End</h2>
        <p>The current system is full of dead ends. A student might know about a campus counselor, a helpline, and a commercial app, but there is no connection between them. 'Sahayata' changes that. It creates a single, safe environment where a student can move seamlessly between different levels of care. They can start with a self-help tool, move to the anonymous peer forum, and then decide to talk to a professional—all within the same trusted space. This ensures that no student falls through the cracks.</p>

        <h2>A Foundation of Trust in a World of Risk</h2>
        <p>This is what makes 'Sahayata' truly different. The commercial app market is a risky place, with no regulation and little reason to trust them with your most private thoughts. 'Sahayata' is built to be the opposite—a gold standard of safety and trust.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Professionals You Can Trust:</strong> We personally verify the qualifications of every single therapist on our platform. Students will know they are talking to a real, qualified professional.</li>
          <li><strong>Your Privacy is Our Priority:</strong> Because we are not a commercial company, our goal is not to sell your data. We build 'Sahayata' with the highest levels of encryption and privacy protection. This is our promise to students: this is your safe space.</li>
          <li><strong>Based on Science, Not Hype:</strong> Every tool and technique in 'Sahayata' is based on proven, evidence-based science. We are not offering empty promises; we are offering real, effective help.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preventing a Crisis, Not Just Managing It</h2>
        <p>Most systems today are reactive. They wait for a crisis to happen. 'Sahayata' is designed to be proactive. Its main goal is to give students the skills and resilience to manage stress <em>before</em> it becomes a crisis. By building healthy habits and a supportive community, we can change the story from one of reaction to one of prevention and hope.</p>
