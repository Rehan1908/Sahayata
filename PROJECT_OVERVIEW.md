- **Financial Stress**: Rising education costs and uncertain job prospects  
- **Cultural Expectations**: Family pressure and stigma around mental health
- **Social Isolation**: Being away from home without support systems
- **Broken Support Systems**: Inadequate campus counseling and unsafe commercial apps
